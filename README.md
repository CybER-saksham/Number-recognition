# Number-recognition
Successfully built a Python deep learning project on Numbert recognition system. We have built and trained the Convolutional neural network which is very effective for image classification purposes. Later on, we build the GUI where we draw a digit on the canvas then we classify the digit and show the results.

Use MDF5 for viewing dataset as it is easy to view.
